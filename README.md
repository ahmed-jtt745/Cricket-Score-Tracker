# Cricket-Score-Tracker
This project is a console-based cricket match simulator built in C++. It allows two teams to play a match by entering overs, players, and real-time ball-by-ball inputs. The system manages both innings, keeps track of batsmen and bowlersâ€™ performances, calculates scores, run rates, and finally displays a detailed scoreboard with match statistics.
